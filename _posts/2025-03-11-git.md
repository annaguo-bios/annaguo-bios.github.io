> This post is a summary note based on what I learned on DATA 550: Data Science Toolkit. I want to recap what I’ve learned but also refine and expand on it, turning it into a clear, actionable workflow that I can rely on for future projects. It’s about creating a practical guide that I—and hopefully others—can follow with ease.

## Step 1. Setting Up Git

<br>

#### Install Git

Git is a version control system that helps track changes in your code and collaborate with others. To start, you need to install it on your system.

- **Linux**: `sudo apt install git`
- **Mac**: `brew install git`
- **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

<br>

#### Checking If Git is Installed

To confirm Git is installed, run:

```bash
git --version
```

<br>

#### Configure Git

After installing Git, you need to set up your user identity so that Git can properly attribute changes to you

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

<br>

## Step 2. Initializing a Git Repository

A Git repository (repo) is where all version history for a project is stored.

<br>

#### Create a New Repository

Navigate to the project folder (on your local computer) and initialize a Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

This creates a hidden `.git` folder that Git uses to track changes.

<br>

#### Track and Save Changes

To start tracking files, add them to Git and make an initial commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

<br>

## Step 3. Tracking Changes & Committing

<br>

#### Add and Commit Files

The `add` command tells git which file you want to track on. `git add .` will track all the files in the current directory. The `commit` command then takes a snapshot on the added files, to track the current changes.



```bash
git add filename.txt  # Add specific file
git add .             # Add all changes
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

<br>

#### Check File Status

Check which files have been modified:

```bash
git status
```

<br>

#### Viewing Commit History

To see previous commits:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

---

<br>

## Step 4. Moving this workflow online: GitHub

GitHub is a platform that lets you store Git repositories online and collaborate with others.

<br>

#### Generate SSH Key (for authentication)

We will need SSH keys to build secure connections between our local computer and GitHub. The following command generates the key pair.

```bash
ssh-keygen -o -t rsa
```

<br>

After generating an SSH key, you need to add it to GitHub to connect your local machine with GitHub. 

Here’s how:

1. **Copy Your SSH Key**
    Run the following command to copy your public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   This will display the key. Copy the entire output.

   <br>

2. **Add the Key to GitHub**

   - Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys**
   - Click **New SSH Key**
   - Paste your copied key into the provided box
   - Click **Add SSH Key**

   <br>

3. **Verify the Connection**
    Run the following command to check if GitHub recognizes your key:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   If successful, you should see a message like:

   ```bash
   Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

You may see messages like "The authenticity of host 'github.com' can't be established" while trying to connect to GitHub via SSH, it means that your SSH client (such as OpenSSH) doesn't recognize the host key for GitHub's server.

This message typically appears the first time you attempt to connect to a remote server using SSH. To proceed, you typically have the option to accept the authenticity of the host by typing "yes" when prompted. 

<br>

#### Connect Local Repository to GitHub

1. Create a repository on GitHub. It’s like your project’s home base. This is where all your Git history, changes, and progress will live, making it easy to keep track of everything as you work. Think of it as your project’s storybook, documenting every step along the way.

   <br>

2. Connect your local repository to the one you just created on GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```

This ties your local project to the remote repository, so you can easily push your changes and keep everything in sync. Think of it as building a bridge between your computer and GitHub.

<br>

3. Push code to GitHub:

```bash
git branch main  # Rename to main if needed
git push origin main
```

---

<br>

## Step 5. Pulling & Pushing Changes

<br>

#### Fetch Latest Updates from GitHub

If you are working with a team, you need to pull the latest changes before making new edits:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

<br>

#### Push New Changes to GitHub

After making changes locally, push them to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

<br>

## Step 6. Branching and Merging

Branches allow you to work on new features without affecting the main codebase.

<br>

#### Create and Switch Branches

```bash
git branch new-feature  # Create a new branch
git checkout new-feature  # Switch to it
```

<br>

#### Merge Branches

Once a feature is complete, merge it back into the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

<br>

#### Delete a Branch

After merging, you can delete the feature branch:

```bash
git branch -d new-feature
```

---

<br>

## Step 7. Undoing Changes

<br>

#### Undo Last Commit (Keep Changes)

Revert the last commit but keep the changes staged:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

<br>

#### Undo Last Commit (Discard Changes)

Revert the last commit and remove all changes:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```



#### Discard Changes in a File

Revert a specific file to the last committed version:

```bash
git checkout -- filename.txt
```

---

<br>

## Step 8. Working with Remote Repositories

<br>

#### Cloning a Repository

Copy an existing repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

<br>

#### Forking a Repository

Forking allows you to make changes to someone else’s repository without affecting the original.

1. Click **Fork** on the repository page.

2. Clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo.git
   ```

<br>

#### Submitting a Pull Request

A pull request (PR) lets others review and merge your changes.

1. Push changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin branch-name
   ```

2. On GitHub, go to **Pull Requests** and click **New Pull Request**.

<br>

#### Merging a Pull Request

Once approved, you can merge the PR into the main branch.

<br>

#### Syncing with Upstream Repository

Keep your fork updated with changes from the original repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

---

<br>

## Step 9. Managing Large Files & Ignoring Files

<br>

#### Use .gitignore to Ignore Files

Specify files and folders that should not be tracked by Git.
Create a `.gitignore` file and add:

```
output/*.rds
output/*.png
```

<br>

#### Track Large Files with Git LFS

Git LFS (Large File Storage) helps manage large files efficiently:

```bash
git lfs track "*.dta"
```
