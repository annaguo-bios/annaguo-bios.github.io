I am a Biostatistics Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) at Emory University under the supervision of [Razieh Nabi](https://raziehnabi.com). My research interests center around causal inference and semiparametric statistics, with a particular focus on developing methodologies in the context of missing data with causal graphical models.
