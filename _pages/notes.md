title: Notes
description: I like writing my own notes for important topics learned. I visit those notes every now and then. Even though some of them are just a re-organization of the original course materials, I find it helpful to go through the whole course, and re-arrange knowledge in my own favored ways. Most of the notes are short cause I found myself never open the 100-page Analysis note again but turn to two pages cheat sheet quite often.
